## Words

We researched documentation extensively, and it turns out that the best sentences in the world consist primarily of words.

### Define new or unfamiliar terms

* If the term already exists, link to a good existing explanation. (Don't reinvent the wheel.)
* If your document is introducing the term, define the term. If your document is introducing many terms, collect the definitions into a glossary.

### Use terms consistently

When I encounter two words that seem to be synonyms, I wonder if the author is trying to signal a subtle distinction that I need to track down and understand.

For example, the following paragraph mistakenly renames Protocol Buffers to protobufs:
Protocol Buffers provide their own definition language. Blah, blah, blah. And that's why protobufs have won so many county fairs.

For correct example: Protocol Buffers (or protobufs for short) provide their own definition language. Blah, blah, blah. And that's why protobufs have won so many county fairs.

### Use acronyms properly

On the initial use of an unfamiliar acronym within a document or a section, spell out the full term, and then put the acronym in parentheses

For example:

If no cache entry exists, the Mixer calls the OttoGroup Server (OGS) to fetch Ottos for the request. The OGS is a repository that holds all servable Ottos. The OGS is organized in a logical tree structure, with a root node and two levels of leaf nodes. The OGS root forwards the request to the leaves and collects the responses.

_Note_: Do not cycle back-and-forth between the acronym and the expanded version in the same document.

### Use the acronym or the full term?

* Don't define acronyms that would only be used a few times.
* Do define acronyms that meet both of the following criteria:
    * The acronym is significantly shorter than the full term.
    * The acronym appears many times in the document.

### Recognize ambiguous pronouns

* Only use a pronoun after you've introduced the noun; never use the pronoun before you've introduced the noun.
* Place the pronoun as close as possible to the referring noun. In general, if more than five words separate your noun from your pronoun, consider repeating the noun instead of using the pronoun.
* If you introduce a second noun between your noun and your pronoun, reuse your noun instead of using a pronoun.
