A cool reviewing pyramid

## 1. Why most pull request reviews suck

- Pull requests work better for asynchronous communication.

- We must demand more from adult professional software engineers than “don’t be mean” and “try being nice.”.

- In fact, in most pull request reviews, it is dead obvious that the reviewer did not pull down or run the code at all. This is flatly unacceptable.

## 2. Instead, reviewers: put your money where your mouth is.

- If the reviewer lacks sufficient context to modify the code themselves, the pull request has failed on the goal of context transfer.

- Copy-pastable code when we know this code work (already tried in the script and saw it work).

- A reviewer spending this time is still a better use of resources than having the original developer chase down solutions suggested by lazy, delegating commentary on their pull request.

## 3. Other things I try to do in pull request reviews
- Where additional documentation would be relevant to the changes I am suggesting, providing links to that documentation.

- Spending time asking questions
  => If something prevents the original developer from continuing to develop this code, it becomes my responsibility. I must be prepared to handle that responsibility. And I’m not judging another developer’s choices until I have asked all my questions.

## 4. Conclusion
- It points out what’s working and what’s not, and links to documentation where useful.
- Asks questions before making assumptions or judgments.
- It explains the reasoning behind suggestions, whether that reasoning affects functionality or adheres to convention.
