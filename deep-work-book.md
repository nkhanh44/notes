# The Rules of Deep Work
## Work Deeply
Add routines & rituals designed to minimize the amount of willpower (which is limited) to get into a state of unbroken attention.

## Embrace Boredom
- Don’t take breaks from distraction, take breaks from focus.
- Meditate productively (walks/runs).
- Structure your deep thinking: What question do you want to answer or problem do you want to solve?

## Quit Social Media

- Measure/track time my spent on deep work and my time spent on email, social media, and other shallow work. Use planner/calendar to jot down start/end times.

- Set end point of work day (5:30 pm) and create a shutdown ritual that includes closing loop on tasks/goals: put outstanding, unfinished tasks in Basecamp (our project management program), write my “top 3” priorities for the following day.

---

Deep Work = Work performed in a distraction-free environment that pushes cognitive capacities to the limit, creates new value, improves your skill, and is hard to replicate.

Shallow Work = Non cognitively-demanding, logistical-style tasks that are easy to replicate.

**(Time Spent) X (Intensity of Focus) = Amount of High-Quality Work Produced**

Free time is unstructured and requires much greater effort to be shaped into something that can be enjoyed. So even our free, leisure time can be viewed in the framework of deep vs. shallow (Similar to the “effortful fun” Laura Vandkerkam describes in Off the Clock.)
## Ask:

- Do they serve a purpose?

- Are they redundant with something else I use?

- If I take the time to learn to use them better/more effectively, will they help me reach my goals?

- How can I use them more effectively?

- Any that I should get rid of?
